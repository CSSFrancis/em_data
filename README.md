EM Data
-------

This is a simple project for aggrogating different Electron Micrscopy Files which are hosted over different sources.  It uses pooch to download datasets and should be 
used as a way to host simple example datasets for method validation. 

Data is stored in a file "User/em_database" but this can be also set to a custom location. 

Additional website with searchable datasets are to come.
